Dependencies
============

ABySS requires the following libraries:

* [Boost](http://www.boost.org)
* [sparsehash](http://code.google.com/p/sparsehash)
* [Open MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org)

ABySS requires a C++ compiler that supports
[OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org) such as [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org).

Compiling ABySS from source
===========================

To compile and install ABySS in `/usr/local`:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

To install ABySS in a specified directory:

	./configure --prefix=/opt/abyss
	make
	sudo make install

ABySS uses OpenMP for parallelization, which requires a modern
compiler such as GCC 4.2 or greater. If you have an older compiler, it
is best to upgrade your compiler if possible. If you have multiple
versions of GCC installed, you can specify a different compiler:

	./configure CC=gcc-4.6 CXX=g++-4.6

ABySS requires the Boost C++ libraries. Many systems come with Boost
installed. If yours does not, you can download
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download).
It is not necessary to compile Boost before installing it. The Boost
header file directory should be found at `/usr/include/boost`, in the
ABySS source directory, or its location specified to `configure`:

	./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/include

If you wish to build the parallel assembler with MPI support,
MPI should be found in `/usr/include` and `/usr/lib` or its location
specified to `configure`:

	./configure --with-mpi=/usr/lib/openmpi

ABySS should be built using the sparsehash library to reduce memory
usage, although it will build without. sparsehash should be found in
`/usr/include` or its location specified to `configure`:

	./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

The default maximum k-mer size is 64 and may be decreased to reduce
memory usage or increased at compile time:

	./configure --enable-maxk=96

If you encounter compiler warnings, you may ignore them like so:

	make AM_CXXFLAGS=-Wall

To run ABySS, its executables should be found in your `PATH`. If you
installed ABySS in `/opt/abyss`, add `/opt/abyss/bin` to your `PATH`:

	PATH=/opt/abyss/bin:$PATH

Assembling a paired-end library
===============================

To assemble paired reads in two files named `reads1.fa` and
`reads2.fa` into contigs in a file named `ecoli-contigs.fa`, run the
command:

	abyss-pe name=ecoli k=64 in='reads1.fa reads2.fa'

The parameter `in` specifies the input files to read, which may be in
FASTA, FASTQ, qseq, export, SRA, SAM or BAM format and compressed with
gz, bz2 or xz and may be tarred. The assembled contigs will be stored
in `${name}-contigs.fa`.

A pair of reads must be named with the suffixes `/1` and `/2` to
identify the first and second read, or the reads may be named
identically. The paired reads may be in separate files or interleaved
in a single file.

Reads without mates should be placed in a file specified by the
parameter `se` (single-end). Reads without mates in the paired-end
files will slow down the paired-end assembler considerably during the
`abyss-fixmate` stage.

Assembling multiple libraries
=============================

The distribution of fragment sizes of each library is calculated
empirically by aligning paired reads to the contigs produced by the
single-end assembler, and the distribution is stored in a file with
the extension `.hist`, such as `ecoli-3.hist`. The N50 of the
single-end assembly must be well over the fragment-size to obtain an
accurate empirical distribution.

Here's an example scenario of assembling a data set with two different
fragment libraries and single-end reads:

 * Library `pe200` has reads in two files,
   `pe200_1.fa` and `pe200_2.fa`.
 * Library `pe500` has reads in two files,
   `pe500_1.fa` and `pe500_2.fa`.
 * Single-end reads are stored in two files, `se1.fa` and `se2.fa`.

The command line to assemble this example data set is:

	abyss-pe k=64 name=ecoli lib='pe200 pe500' \
		pe200='pe200_1.fa pe200_2.fa' pe500='pe500_1.fa pe500_2.fa' \
		se='se1.fa se2.fa'

The empirical distribution of fragment sizes will be stored in two
files named `pe200-3.hist` and `pe500-3.hist`. These files may be
plotted to check that the empirical distribution agrees with the
expected distribution. The assembled contigs will be stored in
`${name}-contigs.fa`.

Scaffolding
===========

Long-distance mate-pair libraries may be used to scaffold an assembly.
Specify the names of the mate-pair libraries using the parameter `mp`.
The scaffolds will be stored in the file `${name}-scaffolds.fa`.
Here's an example of assembling a data set with two paired-end
libraries and two mate-pair libraries:

	abyss-pe k=64 name=ecoli lib='pe1 pe2' mp='mp1 mp2' \
		pe1='pe1_1.fa pe1_2.fa' pe2='pe2_1.fa pe2_2.fa' \
		mp1='mp1_1.fa mp1_2.fa' mp2='mp2_1.fa mp2_2.fa'

The mate-pair libraries are used only for scaffolding and do not
contribute towards the consensus sequence.

Optimizing the parameter k
==========================

To find the optimal value of `k`, run multiple assemblies and inspect
the assembly contiguity statistics. The following shell snippet will
assemble for every value of `k` from 20 to 40.

	export k
	for k in {20..40}; do
		mkdir k$k
		abyss-pe -C k$k name=ecoli in=../reads.fa
	done
	abyss-fac k*/ecoli-contigs.fa

The default maximum value for `k` is 64. This limit may be changed at
compile time using the `--enable-maxk` option of configure. It may be
decreased to 32 to decrease memory usage or increased to 96.

Parallel processing
===================

The `np` option of `abyss-pe` specifies the number of processes to
use for the parallel MPI job. Without any MPI configuration, this will
allow you to use multiple cores on a single machine. To use multiple
machines for assembly, you must create a `hostfile` for `mpirun`,
which is described in the `mpirun` man page.

*Do not* run `mpirun -np 8 abyss-pe`. To run ABySS with 8 threads, use
`abyss-pe np=8`. The `abyss-pe` driver script will start the MPI
process, like so: `mpirun -np 8 ABYSS-P`.

The paired-end assembly stage is multithreaded, but must run on a
single machine. The number of threads to use may be specified with the
parameter `j`. The default value for `j` is the value of `np`.

Running ABySS on a cluster
==========================

ABySS integrates well with cluster job schedulers, such as:

 * SGE (Sun Grid Engine)
 * Portable Batch System (PBS)
 * Load Sharing Facility (LSF)
 * IBM LoadLeveler

For example, to submit an array of jobs to assemble every odd value of
`k` between 51 and 63 using 64 processes for each job:

	mkdir k{51..63}
	qsub -N ecoli -pe openmpi 64 -t 51-63:2 \
		<<<'abyss-pe -C k$SGE_TASK_ID in=/data/reads.fa'
